# All Carriers - Warehouse Selection Improvement

## Date: October 14, 2025
## Scope: Standardized warehouse/pickup location handling across ALL carriers

---

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive warehouse selection system that correctly handles different carrier requirements. Each carrier now properly indicates whether it needs:
1. **Pre-registered warehouse IDs** (from carrier API)
2. **Pre-registered aliases** (from carrier API)
3. **Full address** (from site database)

---

## Problem Statement

Different carriers have different pickup address requirements:
- **BigShip**: Requires `pickup_location_id` (numeric ID like 192676)
- **Ekart**: Requires registered address alias (string like "Bright Academy")
- **Delhivery**: Requires registered warehouse name/alias
- **Xpressbees**: Accepts full pickup address in each request
- **Others**: Mix of registered and full address requirements

Previously, the system wasn't handling these differences correctly, causing:
- Warehouse selection being ignored
- Wrong format sent to carriers
- Silent fallbacks to default warehouses
- Admin panel showing wrong warehouse options

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Extended CarrierAdapterInterface

**File:** `app/Services/Shipping/Contracts/CarrierAdapterInterface.php`

Added new method:
```php
/**
 * Get warehouse requirement type for this carrier
 * 
 * Returns one of:
 * - 'registered_id': Carrier requires pre-registered warehouse ID (e.g., BigShip)
 * - 'registered_alias': Carrier requires pre-registered warehouse alias/name (e.g., Ekart, Delhivery)  
 * - 'full_address': Carrier accepts full pickup address in each request (e.g., Xpressbees)
 *
 * @return string 'registered_id'|'registered_alias'|'full_address'
 */
public function getWarehouseRequirementType(): string;
```

### 2. Updated All Carrier Adapters

Added `getWarehouseRequirementType()` to all 11 carrier adapters:

| Carrier | Type | Note |
|---------|------|------|
| **BigShip** | `registered_id` | Uses numeric warehouse_id from BigShip API |
| **Ekart** | `registered_alias` | Uses string alias from Ekart address registration |
| **Delhivery** | `registered_alias` | Uses registered warehouse name |
| **Xpressbees** | `full_address` | Accepts full pickup address |
| **DTDC** | `full_address` | Accepts full pickup address |
| **BlueDart** | `full_address` | Uses customer code + full address |
| **Ecom Express** | `full_address` | Accepts full pickup address |
| **Shadowfax** | `full_address` | Accepts full pickup address |
| **Shiprocket** | `full_address` | Can use full address or pickup locations |
| **FedEx** | `full_address` | Requires full address with account number |
| **Rapidshyp** | `full_address` | Accepts full address or hub codes |

### 3. Updated MultiCarrierShippingService

**File:** `app/Services/Shipping/MultiCarrierShippingService.php`

Modified `getPickupAddress()` method (lines 765-847) to intelligently route based on carrier type:

```php
protected function getPickupAddress($warehouseIdentifier, ShippingCarrier $carrier): array
{
    $adapter = $this->carrierFactory->make($carrier);
    $requirementType = $adapter->getWarehouseRequirementType();

    switch ($requirementType) {
        case 'registered_id':
            // Return just the ID for carriers like BigShip
            return ['warehouse_id' => $warehouseIdentifier];

        case 'registered_alias':
            // Return carrier-registered address for carriers like Ekart/Delhivery
            return $this->getCarrierRegisteredPickupAddress($warehouseIdentifier, $carrier);

        case 'full_address':
        default:
            // Convert warehouse to full address for carriers like Xpressbees
            if (is_numeric($warehouseIdentifier)) {
                $warehouse = Warehouse::active()->find($warehouseIdentifier);
                return $warehouse ? $warehouse->toPickupAddress() : $this->getDefaultPickupAddress();
            }
            return $this->getDefaultPickupAddress();
    }
}
```

### 4. Updated WarehouseController

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Api/WarehouseController.php`

Modified `getCarrierWarehouses()` method (lines 188-263) to return appropriate warehouses:

```php
public function getCarrierWarehouses(int $carrierId): JsonResponse
{
    $adapter = $factory->make($carrier);
    $requirementType = $adapter->getWarehouseRequirementType();

    switch ($requirementType) {
        case 'registered_id':
        case 'registered_alias':
            // Fetch from carrier API
            return registered warehouses with metadata:
            {
                "requirement_type": "registered_id",
                "source": "carrier_api",
                "note": "These are pre-registered warehouses from BigShip"
            }

        case 'full_address':
            // Return site warehouses from database
            return database warehouses with metadata:
            {
                "requirement_type": "full_address",
                "source": "database",
                "note": "Select site warehouse. Full address will be sent to Xpressbees"
            }
    }
}
```

## Admin Panel UX Flow

### Scenario 1: BigShip (registered_id)

**Step 1:** User navigates to `/orders/27/create-shipment`

**Step 2:** User selects "BigShip" carrier

**Step 3:** Admin panel calls:
```
GET /api/admin/shipping/carriers/9/warehouses
```

**Step 4:** Response shows:
```
Source: carrier_api
Note: "These are pre-registered warehouses from BigShip"

Warehouses:
- Bright Academy (ID: 192676, Pincode: 700009)
- Book Bharat Babanpur (ID: 190935, Pincode: 743122)
```

**Step 5:** User selects "Bright Academy"

**Step 6:** On shipment creation, sends:
```json
{
  "carrier_id": 9,
  "warehouse_id": "192676",  // ← Numeric ID
  ...
}
```

**Step 7:** Backend passes to BigShip:
```json
{
  "warehouse_detail": {
    "pickup_location_id": 192676,  // ← Correctly formatted
    "return_location_id": 192676
  }
}
```

### Scenario 2: Xpressbees (full_address)

**Step 1-2:** User selects "Xpressbees" carrier

**Step 3:** Admin panel calls:
```
GET /api/admin/shipping/carriers/2/warehouses
```

**Step 4:** Response shows:
```
Source: database
Note: "Select site warehouse. Full address will be sent to Xpressbees"

Warehouses:
- Main Warehouse (ID: 1, Pincode: 110001)
- Secondary Warehouse (ID: 2, Pincode: 700009)
```

**Step 5:** User selects "Main Warehouse"

**Step 6:** On shipment creation, sends:
```json
{
  "carrier_id": 2,
  "warehouse_id": "1",  // ← Database warehouse ID
  ...
}
```

**Step 7:** Backend:
1. Fetches Warehouse #1 from database
2. Extracts full address
3. Sends to Xpressbees:
```json
{
  "pickup_customer_name": "BookBharat",
  "pickup_customer_phone": "9876543210",
  "pickup_address": "123 Main St",
  "pickup_city": "Delhi",
  "pickup_pincode": "110001",
  "pickup_state": "Delhi"
}
```

## Admin Panel Integration

### Warehouse Dropdown Logic

```javascript
// When carrier is selected
onCarrierSelect(carrierId) {
  // Fetch carrier-specific warehouses
  GET /api/admin/shipping/carriers/${carrierId}/warehouses
  
  // Response includes:
  {
    requirement_type: 'registered_id' | 'registered_alias' | 'full_address',
    source: 'carrier_api' | 'database',
    note: 'User-friendly explanation',
    data: [/* warehouses */]
  }
  
  // Display warehouses with appropriate UI:
  if (source === 'carrier_api') {
    showBadge('Pre-registered with carrier');
    disableEdit(); // Can't modify carrier warehouses
  } else {
    showBadge('Site warehouse');
    enableEdit(); // Can manage in warehouse settings
  }
}
```

### Visual Indicators

**For Registered Warehouses (BigShip, Ekart):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📍 Bright Academy                       │

│ Pincode: 700009                         │
│ [Pre-registered with BigShip]           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**For Site Warehouses (Xpressbees):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🏢 Main Warehouse                       │

## Technical Implementation Details

### Warehouse Data Flow

#### Type 1: registered_id (BigShip)
```
Admin selects warehouse
    ↓
warehouse_id = "192676"
    ↓
MultiCarrierShippingService detects: registered_id
    ↓
Returns: ['warehouse_id' => '192676']
    ↓
BigshipAdapter receives in $data['warehouse_id']
    ↓
Uses directly: pickup_location_id = 192676
```

#### Type 2: registered_alias (Ekart, Delhivery)
```
Admin selects warehouse
    ↓
warehouse_id = "Bright Academy"
    ↓
MultiCarrierShippingService detects: registered_alias
    ↓
Calls: getCarrierRegisteredPickupAddress("Bright Academy", carrier)
    ↓
Returns: Full address object from carrier's registered list
    ↓
EkartAdapter uses registered alias in API call
```

#### Type 3: full_address (Xpressbees, DTDC, etc.)
```
Admin selects warehouse
    ↓
warehouse_id = "1"
    ↓
MultiCarrierShippingService detects: full_address
    ↓
Fetches: Warehouse::find(1)
    ↓
Converts: $warehouse->toPickupAddress()
    ↓
Returns: {
  name: "BookBharat",
  phone: "9876543210",
  address_1: "123 Main St",
  city: "Delhi",
  pincode: "110001",
  ...
}
    ↓
XpressbeesAdapter formats to their specific structure
```

## Logging & Debugging

### New Log Messages

**Warehouse Selection:**
```
Processing warehouse selection {
  warehouse_identifier: "192676",
  carrier_code: "BIGSHIP",
  requirement_type: "registered_id"
}
```

**Successful Resolution:**
```
Carrier uses registered warehouse IDs {
  warehouse_id: "192676"
}
```

**Fallback Warning:**
```
Warehouse selection failed, using default pickup address {
  requested_warehouse: "999",
  carrier_code: "BIGSHIP"
}
```

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check warehouse requirement for all carriers
php test_all_carriers_warehouse_types.php

# Test specific carrier warehouse API
curl http://localhost:8000/api/admin/shipping/carriers/9/warehouses

# Monitor logs during shipment creation
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep warehouse
```

---

## Database Schema

### Site Warehouses Table
```sql
warehouses (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    code VARCHAR(50),
    address_line_1 TEXT,
    address_line_2 TEXT,
    city VARCHAR(100),
    state VARCHAR(100),
    pincode VARCHAR(10),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    contact_person VARCHAR(255),
    is_active BOOLEAN,
    is_default BOOLEAN
)
```

### Carrier Warehouse Mapping (Future Enhancement)
```sql
carrier_warehouse (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    carrier_id INT,
    warehouse_id INT,
    carrier_warehouse_id VARCHAR(255),    -- For registered_id types
    carrier_warehouse_name VARCHAR(255),   -- For registered_alias types
    is_enabled BOOLEAN,
    is_registered BOOLEAN,
    last_synced_at TIMESTAMP
)
```
