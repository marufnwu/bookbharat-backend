# UI Layout Fix - Create Shipment Page

## Issue
The left sidebar on `/orders/27/create-shipment` was getting cut off when the right section (with advanced filters) was very long. The "Create Shipment" button at the bottom of the sidebar wasn't visible.

## Root Cause
- Left sidebar was `sticky top-6` but had no max height
- Right section with advanced filtering is ~1000+ lines tall
- Sidebar couldn't show all content within viewport
- Create Shipment button was below the fold

## Solution Applied

### Changed Sidebar Styling
```tsx
// BEFORE (causing issue)
<div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 sticky top-6">

// AFTER (fixed)
<div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 sticky top-6 max-h-[calc(100vh-8rem)] overflow-y-auto">
```

### What This Does
- `max-h-[calc(100vh-8rem)]` - Limits sidebar height to viewport minus 8rem (for header/padding)
- `overflow-y-auto` - Makes sidebar scrollable when content exceeds height
- `sticky top-6` - Keeps sidebar stuck to top while scrolling main content

## Result

3. ✅ **Better UX** - No content cut off
4. ✅ **Responsive** - Works on all screen sizes
