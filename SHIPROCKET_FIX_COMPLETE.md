# Shiprocket Integration - Complete Fix

## Date: October 14, 2025
## Status: ✅ **WORKING & PRODUCTION READY**

---

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Authentication Endpoint URL Duplication
**Problem:** The authentication URL was being constructed incorrectly, resulting in:
```
https://apiv2.shiprocket.in/v1/external/v1/external/auth/login
```
The `/v1/external` was duplicated!

**Root Cause:** `validateCredentials()` was appending `/v1/external/auth/login` to `$this->baseUrl` which already contained `https://apiv2.shiprocket.in/v1/external`

**Fix Applied:**
```php
// BEFORE
$response = Http::post("{$this->baseUrl}/v1/external/auth/login", [...]);

// AFTER  
$response = Http::post("{$this->baseUrl}/auth/login", [...]);
```

**Location:** `ShiprocketAdapter.php` line 349

---

### 2. Type Error in Delivery Days
**Problem:** Shiprocket API returns `estimated_delivery_days` as a string (e.g., "4"), but Carbon's `addDays()` expects an integer.

**Error:**
```
Carbon\Carbon::rawAddUnit(): Argument #3 ($value) must be of type int|float, string given
```

**Fix Applied:**
```php
// BEFORE
'delivery_days' => $courier['estimated_delivery_days'] ?? 3,
'estimated_delivery_date' => now()->addDays($courier['estimated_delivery_days'] ?? 3)->format('Y-m-d'),

// AFTER
$deliveryDays = intval($courier['estimated_delivery_days'] ?? 3);

'delivery_days' => $deliveryDays,
'estimated_delivery_date' => now()->addDays($deliveryDays)->format('Y-m-d'),
```

**Location:** `ShiprocketAdapter.php` lines 463-476

---

### 3. Missing Interface Methods
**Problem:** Shiprocket adapter was missing several CarrierAdapterInterface methods

**Methods Added:**
- ✅ `getRates(array $shipment): array`
- ✅ `getRateAsync(array $shipment): PromiseInterface`
- ✅ `printLabel(string $trackingNumber): string`
- ✅ `getWarehouseRequirementType(): string`

**Methods Updated:**
- ✅ `checkServiceability()` - Updated signature to match interface
- ✅ `createShipment()` - Updated to use standard data structure
- ✅ `trackShipment()` - Updated to return standard format
- ✅ `schedulePickup()` - Updated signature to match interface

**Location:** `ShiprocketAdapter.php` various lines

---

### 4. Constructor Error Handling
**Problem:** Constructor would fail if credentials weren't configured

**Fix Applied:**
```php
// Added safe authentication with fallback
if (!empty($config['email']) && !empty($config['password'])) {
    try {
        $this->authToken = $this->getAuthToken();
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        Log::warning('Shiprocket authentication skipped during construction');
        $this->authToken = '';
    }
} else {
    $this->authToken = '';
}
```

**Location:** `ShiprocketAdapter.php` lines 16-35

---

### 5. Carrier Activation
**Problem:** Shiprocket was inactive in database

**Fix Applied:**
```php
// Activated via tinker
$shiprocket = ShippingCarrier::where('code', 'SHIPROCKET')->first();
$shiprocket->is_active = true;
$shiprocket->save();
```

## Warehouse Handling

**Shiprocket Warehouse Type:** `full_address`

**Admin Panel Behavior:**
- Shows site warehouses from database
- Admin selects local warehouse (e.g., "Main Warehouse")
- Backend extracts full address from database
- Sends complete pickup address to Shiprocket API

**Example Flow:**
```
Admin selects: Shiprocket - Xpressbees Surface (₹95.50)
    ↓
Warehouse dropdown shows: Site warehouses from database
    ↓
Green badge: "Select site warehouse. Full address will be sent to Shiprocket"
    ↓
Admin selects: Main Warehouse (ID: 1)
    ↓
Backend fetches: Warehouse #1 full address
    ↓
Sends to Shiprocket:
{
  "pickup_location": "Main Warehouse",
  "pickup_address": "123 Main St",
  "pickup_city": "Delhi",
  "pickup_pincode": "110001",
  ...
}
    ↓
✅ Shipment created successfully!
```
