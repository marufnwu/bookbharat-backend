- ✅ `cart/page-mobile-redesign.tsx` - Fixed label
- ✅ `cart/page.tsx` - Fixed label

## Tax Data Flow

### Calculation Flow:
1. User adds items to cart → CartService.getCartSummary()
2. State retrieved from address → getStateFromAddress()
3. OrderContext created with state for tax calculation
4. TaxCalculationService fetches applicable taxes from TaxConfiguration
5. Returns tax breakdown with labels and amounts
6. Frontend displays dynamic tax information

### Frontend Display Flow:
1. Cart summary API returns `tax_amount` and `taxesBreakdown`
2. If `taxesBreakdown` exists → show individual taxes with labels
3. If `taxesBreakdown` is empty → show generic "Tax" label
4. All components use `tax_amount` from API, no manual calculations
