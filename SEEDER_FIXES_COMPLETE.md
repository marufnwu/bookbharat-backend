**Total Production Seeders: 14** (was 11)

1. Core System Setup
   - RolePermissionSeeder
2. Payment Configuration
   - PaymentMethodSeeder
   - PaymentAdminSettingsSeeder
3. **Tax & Order Charges** ⭐ NEW
   - TaxConfigurationSeeder
   - OrderChargeSeeder

- ✅ `OrderChargeSeeder` - Order charges
- ✅ `HomepageSectionSeeder` - Homepage sections
- ✅ `PromotionalCampaignSeeder` - Promotional campaigns

**Total Development Seeders: 22** (was 17)

**Organized by Phases:**

3. **Shipping & Logistics** (7 seeders)
4. **Marketing & Promotions** (4 seeders) ⭐ +1 new
5. **Content & Admin** (3 seeders) ⭐ +1 new
6. **Test Data & Products** (2 seeders) ⭐ +1 new

### 4. **Cleaned Up Deprecated Seeders** 
**Removed 3 deprecated payment seeders:**
- 🗑️ `EnablePaymentGatewaysSeeder.php` - Replaced by PaymentMethodSeeder
- 🗑️ `PaymentConfigurationSeeder.php` - Replaced by PaymentMethodSeeder

These were part of the old messy payment system that was replaced by the clean single-table architecture.
