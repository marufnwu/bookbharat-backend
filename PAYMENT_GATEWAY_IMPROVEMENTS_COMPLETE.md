## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### PayU shows "not available"
**Solution:**
```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php verify_payment_gateways.php
```
Check that credentials are set in Admin UI.

### Hash mismatch error
**Check:**
- View logs: `tail -100 storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "PayU Hash Data"`
- Verify hash format has 6 pipes: `||||||`
- Confirm merchant_salt is correct

### Payment successful but order not updating
**Check:**
- Webhook URL configured in PayU dashboard
- Webhook logs in Admin UI → Payments → Webhook Logs
- Order status in database

## 📈 What's Next

### Recommended Testing Order
1. ✅ **Test PayU payment** (primary goal)
2. Test COD order placement
